Demonstrates how to successively refactor code from Big Switch via Classes to Type Erasure

Over the years, I have written and then refactored a lot of code. More than once, I have stumbled trying to improve a piece of code, because I could not find the right abstraction and the right approach (or I simply didn't know it, then).

There are a lot of books about code design and design patterns, and they have been helpful. They often start with guiding principles (such as SOLID - see "Clean C++" by Stephan Roth, as well as the updated "Clean C++ 20" if you want to know more). Then they either describe how to achieve each principle separately, using examples. Or they go through software design patterns, explain how they work, when to apply them, etc. (see "C++ Software Design" by Klaus Iglberger for an excellent book of this kind).

All of that is very helpful, and helped me become a better programmer. But when you write real code, you rarely just use one design principle, or just use one pattern. You mix and match, combine, taking the best of each to form just the abstraction that fits the problem.
