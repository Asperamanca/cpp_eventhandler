//## 06 - TYPE ERASURE
//
// TODO: Update all comments and MD
//
// The multiple inheritance gave us flexibility to mix-and-match
//  whatever event types we want to implement. But we have again identified
//  some issues to look into:
// 1) CInputRule looks like it shouldn't be a base class, and in any case
//      allows users of that class to cause object slicing.
// 2) The loop over input rule inside CInputRuleManager repeats for each event type
// 3) We also need to dynamic_cast our input rule types a lot
//
// Let's start in inputrulemanager.h to see the changes
//
// At the end, you can return to the end of this file for a wrap-up.

//## WRAP-UP
//
// You have now seen a code refinement from single function with a big switch
//  to separate functions, separate classes, abstraction via base class and
//  finally a flexible approach using type erasure.
// The order suggests that the first implementation is the worst, and the last
//  implementation is the best. But it's not that simple. Because, as so often,
//  the answer is "it depends..."
// In every refinement, we actually increased the total amount of code. In most
//  refinedments, we added new files. This is a source of complexity that should
//  be taken into account.
// So when I say "it depends..." you fairly ask "...on what?"
//  Let me try to answer in this way:
// In each refinement, the code (as it is) has become more complex IN TOTAL
//  At the same time, we have often reduced complexity LOCALLY.
//  And also, our changes will reduce the ADDITIONAL complexity required to add
//  new event handlers and event handler types.
// For a very simple example that's not expected to change anymore, it's probably
//  best to use the simplest approach possible. Here, I would probably go for "Functions"
//  as it (at least) cleanly separates the different event handlers.
// If you are at the other end of the spectrum, and expect your code to live long
//  and grow bigger and bigger, you need something that can reduce added complexity.
//  Here, the final "Type erasure" or "Multiple inheritance" soltions are likely better.
// If you are somewhere in-between, you may choose the "Inheritance" solution.
//  This is what I mean when I write "it depends...".
